    "3.1 What is a dictionary? Video Transcript\n",
    "How are you feeling so far? Lists and strings are pretty cool, right? These tools let us do a ton of neat stuff in our code so they can be super fun to experiment with. We're now going to learn about another data type, dictionaries. Like lists, dictionaries are used to organize elements into collections. Unlike lists, you don't access elements inside dictionaries using their position. Instead, the data inside dictionaries take the form of pairs of keys and values. To get a dictionary value we use its corresponding key. Another way these two vary is while in a list the index must be a number, in a dictionary you can use a bunch of different data types as keys, like strings, integers, floats, tuples, and more. The name dictionaries comes from how they work in a similar way to human language dictionaries. In an English language dictionary the word comes with a definition.\n",
    "Play video starting at :1:3 and follow transcript1:03\n",
    "In the language of a Python dictionary, the word would be the key and the definition would be the value. Make sense? Let's check out an example. You can create an empty dictionary in a similar way to creating an empty list, except instead of square brackets dictionaries use curly brackets to define their content. Once again, we can use the type function to check that the variable we've just created is a dictionary x = {} type(x). Creating initialized dictionaries isn't too different from the syntax we used in earlier videos to create initialized lists or tuples. But instead of a series of slots with values in them, we have a series of keys that point at values. Okay, let's check out an example dictionary. We'll call it file_counts = and then {\"jpeg\":10, \"txt\":14, \"csv\":2, \"py\":}23 print(file_counts). In this file_counts dictionary, we've stored keys that are strings, like jpg, that point at integer values, like 10. When creating the dictionary we use colons and between the key and the value and separate each pair by commas. In a dictionary, it's perfectly fine to mix and match the data types of keys and values like this and can be very useful. In this example, we're using a dictionary to store the number of files corresponding to each extension. It makes sense to encode the file extension formatting in a string, while it's natural to represent a count as an integer number. Let's say you want to find out how many text files there are in the dictionary. To do this, you would use the key txt to access its associated value. The syntax to do this may look familiar, since we used something similar in our examples of indexing strings, lists, and tuples.\n",
    "Play video starting at :3:27 and follow transcript3:27\n",
    "File_counts [\"txt\"]. You can also use the in keyword to check if a key is contained in a dictionary. Let's try a couple of keys. \"jpg\" in file_counts, True. \"html\" in file_counts, False. Dictionaries are mutable. You might remember what mutable means from an earlier video. That's right, it means we can add remove and replace entries. To add an entry in a dictionary, just use the square brackets to create the key and assign a new value to it. Let's add a file count of eight for a new CFG file extension and dictionary. file_counts [\"cfg\"] = 8 and then print(file_counts). This brings up an interesting point about dictionaries. What do you think will happen if we try to add a key that already exists in the dictionary? file_counts[\"csv\"] = 17, print(file_counts). When you use a key that already exists to set a value, the value that was already paired with that key is replaced. As you can see in this example, the value associated with the csv key used to be 2, but it's now 17. The keys inside of a dictionary are unique. If we try to store two different values for the same key, we'll just replace one with the other. Last off, we can delete elements from a dictionary with the del keyword by passing the dictionary and the key to the element as if we were trying to access it. del file_counts[\"cfg\"] and print(file_counts). What do you think? Dictionaries seem pretty useful, right? We've now seen how to create a dictionary and how to add, modify, and delete elements stored in the dictionary. Up next, we'll discover some interesting things we can do with them.\n"

    "3.2 Dictionaries Defined. Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are another data structure in Python. Theyâ€™re similar to a list in that they can be used to organize data into collections. However, data in a dictionary isn't accessed based on its position. Data in a dictionary is organized into pairs of keys and values. You use the key to access the corresponding value. Where a list index is always a number, a dictionary key can be a different data type, like a string, integer, float, or even tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a dictionary, you use curly brackets: {}. When storing values in a dictionary, the key is specified first, followed by the corresponding value, separated by a colon. For example, animals = {\"bears\": 10, \"lions\": 1, \"tigers\": 2} creates a dictionary with three key value pairs, stored in the variable animals. The key \"bears\" points to the integer value 10, while the key \"lions\" points to the integer value 1, and \"tigers\" points to the integer 2. You can access the values by referencing the key, like this: animals[\"bears\"]. This would return the integer 10, since thatâ€™s the corresponding value for this key.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also check if a key is contained in a dictionary using the in keyword. Just like other uses of this keyword, it will return True if the key is found in the dictionary\n",
    "otherwise it will return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are mutable, meaning they can be modified by adding, removing, and replacing elements in a dictionary, similar to lists. You can add a new key value pair to a dictionary by assigning a value to the key, like this: animals[\"zebras\"] = 2. This creates the new key in the animal dictionary called zebras, and stores the value 2. You can modify the value of an existing key by doing the same thing. So animals[\"bears\"] = 11 would change the value stored in the bears key from 10 to 11. Lastly, you can remove elements from a dictionary by using the del keyword. By doing del animals[\"lions\"] you would remove the key value pair from the animals dictionary.\n"

    "3.3 Iterating over the Contents of a Dictionary Video Transcript\n",
    "\n",
    "[MUSIC] It probably won't come as a surprise that, just like with strings lists and tuples, you can use for loops to iterate through the contents of a dictionary. Let's see how this looks in action. So file_counts = {\"jpg\": 10, \"txt\": 14, \"csv\": 2, \"py\": 23 and then}. And then for extension in file_counts: two spaces print extension. So if you use a dictionary in a for loop, the iteration variable will go through the keys in the dictionary. If you want to access the associated values, you can either use the keys as indexes of the dictionary or you can use the items method which returns a tuple for each element in the dictionary. The tuple's first element is the key. Its second element is the value. Let's try that with our example dictionary. For ext amount in file_counts.items(): print(\"there are and then {} files with the .{} extension\".format(amount, ext)). Sometimes you might just be interested in the keys of a dictionary. Other times you might just want the values. You can access both with their corresponding dictionary methods like this. file_counts.keys() file counts.values(). These methods return special data types related to the dictionary, but you don't need to worry about what they are exactly. You just need to iterate them as you would with any sequence. For value in file_counts.values(): print value. So we can use items to get key value pairs, keys to get the keys, and values to get just the values. Not too hard, right?\n",
    "Play video starting at: 2: 49 and follow transcript2: 49\n",
    "Because we know that each key can be present only once, dictionaries are a great tool for counting elements and analyzing frequency. Let's check out a simple example of counting how many times each letter appears in a piece of text.\n",
    "Play video starting at: 3: 4 and follow transcript3: 04\n",
    "In this code, we're first initializing an empty dictionary, then going through each letter in the given string. For each letter, we check if it's not already in the dictionary. And in that case, we initialize an entry in the dictionary with a value of zero. Finally, we increment the count for that letter in the dictionary. To sum up, we've created a dictionary where the keys are each of the letters present in the string and the values are how many times each letter is present. Let's try out a few example strings. Count_letters. Let's say a, count_letters(\"tenant\") Count_letters, and this time we'll say a long string with a lot of letters.\n",
    "Play video starting at: 4: 2 and follow transcript4: 02\n",
    "Here you can see how the dictionary can have any number of entries and the pairs of key values always count how many of each letter there are in the string. Also, do you see how our simple code doesn't distinguish between actual letters and special characters like a space? To only count the letters, we'd need to specify which characters we're taking into account. This technique might seem simple at first, but it can be really useful in a lot of cases. Let's say for example that you're analyzing logs in your server and you want to count how many times each type of error appears in the log file. You could easily do this with a dictionary by using the type of error as the key and then incrementing the associated value each time you come across that error type. Are you starting to see how dictionaries can be a really useful tool when writing scripts? Coming up, we're going to learn how to tell when to use dictionaries and when to use lists.\n"

    "You can iterate over dictionaries using a for loop, just like with strings, lists, and tuples. This will iterate over the sequence of keys in the dictionary. If you want to access the corresponding values associated with the keys, you could use the keys as indexes. Or you can use the items method on the dictionary, like dictionary.items(). This method returns a tuple for each element in the dictionary, where the first element in the tuple is the key and the second is the value.\n",

    "If you only wanted to access the keys in a dictionary, you could use the keys() method on the dictionary: dictionary.keys(). If you only wanted the values, you could use the values() method: dictionary.values().\n",
